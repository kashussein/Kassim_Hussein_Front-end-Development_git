To convert the image given to me into a webpage the technologies that I utilized on the frontend included: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
My approach to making a fully responsive webpage was to make use of the CSS framework Bootstrap. 
Using Bootstrapâ€™s grid it allowed me to have a responsive page up and running in no time.
